=head1 NAME

agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script merge different gff annotation files in one.
It uses the AGAT parser that takes care of duplicated names and fixes other oddities met in those files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl --gff infile1 --gff infile2 --out outFile
    agat_sp_merge_annotations.pl --help

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--gff> or B<-f>

Input GTF/GFF file(s). You can specify as much file you want like so: -f file1 -f file2 -f file3

=item  B<--out>, B<--output> or B<-o>

Output gff3 file where the gene incriminated will be write.

=item B<-c> or B<--config>

String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any, 
otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose".
The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).

=item B<--help> or B<-h>

Display this helpful text.
