The GTF/GFF format
==================

The GTF/GFF formats are 9-column text formats used to describe and represent genomic features.
The formats have quite evolved since 1997, and despite well-defined specifications existing nowadays they have a great flexibility allowing holding wide variety of information.
This flexibility has a drawback aspect, there is an incredible amount of flavour of the formats, that can result in problems when using downstream programs.
