# agat\_sp\_compare\_two\_annotations.pl

## DESCRIPTION

The script aims to compare two annotation of the same assembly. It provided
information about split/fusion of genes between the two annotations.
The most common case are:
1 => 0 ( gene uniq to file1)
0 => 1 ( gene uniq to file2)
1 => 1 ( 1 gene from file 1 overlaps only 1 gene from file2)
1 => &lt;many> ( 1 gene from file 1 overlaps &lt;many> genes from file2) => split case (with file 1 as reference)
&lt;many> => 1 ( &lt;many> genes from file 1 overlap only 1 gene from file2) => fusion case (with file 1 as reference)

Then you can get more complex cases:
&lt;many> => &lt;many>  (&lt;many> genes from file 1 overlap &lt;many> genes from file2)
