# agat\_sp\_filter\_by\_ORF\_size.pl

## DESCRIPTION

The script reads a gff annotation file, and create two output files,
one contains the gene models with ORF passing the test, the other contains the rest.
By default the test is "> 100" that means all gene models that have ORF longer
than 100 Amino acids, will pass the test.
