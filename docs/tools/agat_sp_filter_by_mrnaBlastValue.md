# agat\_sp\_filter\_by\_mrnaBlastValue.pl

## DESCRIPTION

The script aims to remove from a gff file all the sequence that have a similarity
over THRESHOLD with another sequence (will keep only one).
This is typically useful when creating a list of mRNA to use to train abinitio gene finder.
A reciprocal blast of the sequences need to have been performed prior
to the use of this script in order to get the blastp input file.
