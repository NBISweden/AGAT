# agat\_sp\_filter\_record\_by\_coordinates.pl

## DESCRIPTION

The script aims to filter the records to keep only those contained within coordinates
defined in an input csv file.
A record can be a feature or a set of features with part-of relationships.
By default we keep records overlapping the coordinates. The --exclude parameter
allows to keep only record fully contained within the coordinates.

! With default paramater, an exon out of the coordinates can be kept if the gene
it is part of is overlaping the coordinates.
