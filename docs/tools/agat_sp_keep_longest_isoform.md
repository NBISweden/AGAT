# agat\_sp\_keep\_longest\_isoform.pl

## DESCRIPTION

The script aims to filter isoforms when present. For a locus:
\- when all isoforms have CDS we keep the one with the longest CDS.
\- when some isoforms have CDS some others not, we keep the one with the longest CDS.
\- when none of the isoforms have CDS, we keep the one with the longest concatenated exons.
