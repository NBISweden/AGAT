## test with parallelisation
HARNESS_OPTIONS=j4 make test # for all
HARNESS_OPTIONS="j4" make test_gff_other # for test_gff_other tests only
prove -j4 -I "$PWD/lib" t/gff_syntax/*.t # another way

# create the distribution (optional)
- make manifest
- make dist
=> test local installation with the dist
=> if everything is fine the dist can be provided as an asset with the github release

# PR and merge in master branch

# Docs

To keep the doc sync with the tools we need to generate md file from pod file.
Here some explanation how to do so.

# extract pod
for i in AGAT/bin/*;do name=$(basename $i .pl); perl -MPod::Markdown::Github -e "Pod::Markdown::Github->filter('$i')" > $name.md.full ;done
# remove FEEDBACK info and below
for i in agat_*.full; do name=$(basename $i .full); awk '{if($0 ~ "FEEDBACK" ) exit; print $0}' $i > $name; done
# remove the full pod file now it is useless
rm *.full
# Do not forget to put the md file into docs/tools and update the index.rst accordingly
