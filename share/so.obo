def: "Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. Transfer RNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). Transfer RNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position."

These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation."

def: "The RNA component of Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterized activity is the generation of mature 5 prime ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5 prime leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous. Helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs."

def: "Translational regulation of the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS is mediated by the formation of a double-stranded RNA stem-loop structure in the upstream region of the rpoS messenger RNA, occluding the translation initiation site. Clones carrying rprA (RpoS regulator RNA) increased the translation of RpoS. The rprA gene encodes a 106 nucleotide regulatory RNA. As with DsrA Rfam:RF00014, RprA is predicted to form three stem-loops. Thus, at least two small RNAs, DsrA and RprA, participate in the positive regulation of RpoS translation. Unlike DsrA, RprA does not have an extensive region of complementarity to the RpoS leader, leaving its mechanism of action unclear. RprA is non-essential."

The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00017]

def: "Group II introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron to intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny."

GREEKC consortium individuals pointed out that this did not fit with the other child terms of transcriptional_cis_regulatory_region (SO:0001055), which are currently promoter, CRM and promoter flanking region. No comments about when this term was created exist, no references are listed. GREEKC members assume that this was previously under enhansosome (SO:0001057), which was probably created along with this term but has since been obsoleted. This term can be resurrected as non-obsolete if we can find a reference publication and/or change the name to a term that is commonly used in the field.

The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA." [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rfam/getacc?RF00012]

def: "A codon variant that changes at least one base of the first codon of a transcript." [SO:ke]
comment: This is being used to annotate changes to the first codon of a transcript, when the first annotated codon is not to methionine. A variant is predicted to change the first amino acid of a translation irrespective of the fact that the underlying codon is an AUG. As such for transcripts with an incomplete CDS (sequence does not start with an AUG), it is still called.

comment: Mathematically defined repeat regions are determined without regard to the biological origin of the repetitive region. The repeat units of a MDR are the overlapping oligomers of size k that were used to for the query. Tools that can annotate mathematically defined repeats include Tallymer (Kurtz et al 2008, BMC Genomics: 517) and RePS (Wang et al, Genome Res 12(5): 824-831.).

comment: Moved from is_a biological_region (SO:0001411) to is_a regulatory_region (SO:0005836) on 11 Feb 2021. GREEKC members pointed out that this would be a more appropriate location. See GitHub Issue #530. 11 Feb 2021 updated definition along with addition of epigenomically_modified_region (SO:0002332). Epigenetically modified region is now not inherited while epigenomically modified region is not annotated as inherited. See GitHub Issue #532 and issue #534.

def: "A 5' UTR variant where a premature start codon is introduced, moved or lost." [SANGER:am]
comment: Requested by Andy Menzies at the Sanger. This isn't necessarily a protein coding change. A premature start codon can effect the production of a mature protein product by providing a competing translation start point. Some genes balance their expression this way, eg THPO requires the presence of a premature start to limit expression, its loss leads to Familial thrombocythemia.

They are called moRs because they are not located next to the loop and thus their biogenesis process is a little different, but functionally, they are supposed to act like miRs. It is the same for loRs that are the loop fragments, they are generated differently than miRs or moRs but if loaded into the risc they are supposed to act the same way miRs do.\nRequested by Thomas Desvignes, Jan 2015.

comment: This term is to map to the ANNOVAR term 'ncRNA' http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/gene/ . The description in the documentation (11/23/15) 'variant overlaps a transcript without coding annotation in the gene definition'. and this is further clarified in the document: ncRNA above refers to RNA without coding annotation. It does not mean that this is a RNA that will never be translated; it merely means that the user-selected gene annotation system was not able to give a coding sequence annotation. It could still code protein products and may have such annotations in future versions of gene annotation or in another gene annotation system. For example, BC039000 is regarded as ncRNA by ANNOVAR when using UCSC Known Gene annotation, but it is regarded as a protein-coding gene by ANNOVAR when using ENSEMBL annotation.\n\nIt is further clarified in the comments section as: ncRNA does NOT mean conventional non-coding RNA. It means a RNA without complete coding sequence, and it can be a coding RNA that is annotated incorrectly by RefSeq or other gene definition systems.

comment: Requested by Pablo Cingolani. The way I calculate this is simply by looking at the PDB entry of one protein and then marking those AA that are within 3 Angstrom of each other (and far away in the AA sequence, e.g. over 20 AA distance). The assumption is that, since they are very close in distance, they must be "interacting" and thus important for protein structure.

def: "A gene_member_region that encodes sequence that directly contributes to the molecular function of its gene or gene product." [Clingen:mb]
comment: A functional_gene_region is a sequence feature that resides within a gene. But it is typically the corresponding region of translated/transcribed sequence in a gene product, that performs the molecular function qualifying it as a functional_gene_region. Here, a functional_gene_region must contribute directly to the molecular function of the gene product - regions that code for purely structural elements in a gene product that connect such directly functional elements together are not considered functional_gene_regions. Examples of regions considered 'functional' include those encoding enzymatic activity, binding activity, regions required for localization or membrane association, channel-forming regions, and signal peptides or other elements critical for processing of a gene product. In addition, regions that function at the genomic/DNA level are also included - e.g. regions of sequence known to be critical for binding transcription or splicing factors.

This motif is important for snoRNA stability, processing, nucleolar targeting and function. A small number of box C/D snoRNAs are involved in rRNA processing; most, however, are known or predicted to serve as guide RNAs in ribose methylation of rRNA.

The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA." []

comment: Indels can have a different number of bases than the corresponding reference sequence. The term name was changed from indel to delins on 2/24/2019 to align with the HGVS nomenclature term for a deletion-insertion. Indel was causing confusion in the annotation community (github issue 445). The HGVS nomenclature definition of deletion-insertion (delins) is a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.

Selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved secondary structure in the 3' UTR that is required for the distinction of UGA stop from UGA selenocysteine. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is around 60 nt in length and adopts a hairpin structure which is sufficiently well-defined and conserved to act as a computational screen for selenoprotein genes."
