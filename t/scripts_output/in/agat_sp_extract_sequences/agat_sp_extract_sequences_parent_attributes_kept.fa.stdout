=> Accessing the feature_levels YAML file
Using standard /usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/auto/share/dist/AGAT/feature_levels.yaml file
=> Attribute used to group features when no Parent/ID relationship exists (i.e common tag):
	* locus_tag
	* gene_id
=> merge_loci option deactivated
=> Machine information:
	This script is being run by perl v5.34.0
	Bioperl location being used: /usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/Bio/
	Operating system being used: linux 
=> Accessing Ontology
	No ontology accessible from the gff file header!
	We use the SOFA ontology distributed with AGAT:
		/usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo
	Read ontology /usr/local/share/perl/5.34.0/auto/share/dist/AGAT/so.obo:
		4 root terms, and 2596 total terms, and 1516 leaf terms
	Filtering ontology:
		We found 1861 terms that are sequence_feature or is_a child of it.
