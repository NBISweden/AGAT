Codon table used:1
Results:
26 genes have been modified. These genes have  34 mRNA, and we fixed the ORF of 28 of them.
11 model1: Prediction contains the original prediction but is longer.
2 model2: Longer prediction found non-overlapping the original one.
4 model3: Longer prediction found overlapping the original one but doesn't contain it(frame different).
0 model4: The prediction is shorter due to the presence of stop codon in the original CDS.
11 model5: The prediction is shorter but the original CDS sequence has not premature stop codon
  The original CDS does not start by a start codon, it is probably incomplete or fragmented
  (The adjacent sequence of the start side might be NNNN or XXXX).
  The prediction is probably shorter because it is forced here to use a start codon.
0 model6: The prediction is the same size (AA size) but the original CDS has premature stop codons while the prediction not.
  This is a particular case where a +1 or +2 bp shift at the beginning of the sequence
  gives a frame shift in the original sequence but they are removed within the new prediction.

/!\ Remind: L and M are AA are possible start codons for standard codon table (table 1).
Particular case: If we have a triplet as WTG, AYG, RTG, RTR or ATK it will be seen as a possible start codon (but translated into X)
